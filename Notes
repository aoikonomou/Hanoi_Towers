ok the game has 3 rods and multiple disks of different sizes

the rule is you can move one disk at a time and you cannot put your disk on top of a smaller one



ok, classic iterattion problem 
lol 


ok, so lets make it easy, each rod is an array of 3
ok cool 
1 is the bottom 
3 is the top
ok 



ok so let's play,



grab a disk (ok )

put it in a rod
which rod ?
the middle 

ok, which position should it go?

well, is the bottom one empty?
No
What does it have in it
It has a disk
Is it bigger or smaller
bigger
ok, put it on top
well, there is a nother disk on top
what is it, bigger or smaller?
bigger
ok put it on top
well, there may be something there? well not really but have a check if you want




var rod1 = new Array [] (3 positiions)

function putDisk(diskNum, rodNum){

checkPositions 

put it in the first empty position whilst there isn't a bigger disk below


typeOfDiskIfFull

}

return true or false, if true move thing, if false do not


----------------------


How do i pass the rod variable in. Ok, lets see. variable a, b and c, make a function that selects one, ok, if the incoming variable is 1 then variable 1,
